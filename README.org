We should have a high level overview of what Engagemint is and how it
could be useful to people here.

These are stories about how various users make use of Engagemint

*** Why Sarah chose Engagemint

useful to her.

*** Sarah's big event

This user story talks about Sarah, the event she ran, and what
information she kept after the event.

**** Immediately after the conference

Does she record information here?

**** Later usage

** Interface

*** Users and permissions

Making use of Django's builtins

*** Contacts
*** Events


* Tasks
** TODO Refactor tasks into TASKS.org                               :cwebber:

This one's easy ;)

** DONE Add AUTHORS.org                                             :cwebber:
   CLOSED: [2015-02-05 Thu 11:51]
** DONE Add license stuff                                           :cwebber:
   CLOSED: [2015-02-05 Thu 12:13]
** TODO Add user stories in README.org                            :cdonnelly:

** TODO Fill in database needs in README.org                      :cdonnelly:


** TODO Database-driven bootstrap                                  :tsyesika:

Use a combination of Django ORM and the Django Admin to spec out the
models

*** TODO Write out models
*** TODO Hook up to admin
*** TODO Verify with cdonnelly / kfogel that structure seems right
** TODO Switch over to github issues for tasks

This doesn't need to happen till after the first alpha lands, probably
easier to handle here for now
