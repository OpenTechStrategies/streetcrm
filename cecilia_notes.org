** swoptact prep for demo
1. cosmetics
2. map
*** need to make "add existing participant to event" bit prettier
*** add space between logo and title
*** make "clock" show more times?
*** make swoptact logo not...quite so transparent?
*** make address fields slide down on person profile (not new window)
*** make address dropdown narrow by substring
*** event history shouldnt' show up on "add" screen
*** add location to event history table
*** remove headers from event history table
*** change root/group/users to "swoptact admin page"
*** change directory/url stuff to create /admin and change /swoptact to /
*** logo should point to root of swoptact (not admin)
*** remove addresses from root list
*** on root list: add new event and browse/edit events as only options (same for people)
*** add export option to all lists
*** person list: change "action" to delete button, move to bottom, remove title text
*** call participants people
*** change person list to show name, address, phone, email
*** add "map!" function (or pin icon) (for one or multiple people)
*** event history title: "events that (name) attended"
*** move buttons up above event history on people page (into white space) and same on event page
*** save and stay here (not continue editing) and save and return to list (not save)
*** event list: show location (and date?) and number of participants
*** event page: remove "now" in time and remove "today" (change words to icons on cal and clock)
- add map showing where event is
*** adding people to event:
- arrows further apart, labeled unchoose instead of remove
- get rid of "filter"  (string)
- add new person link/button if zero results
- remove plus from participants:
- change available to "choose" and "chosen" to "attendees"
- remove helptext
- unchoose all should gray out when none to unchoose (And vice versa)
*** Things to demo:
- start at localhost:8000/swoptact (do we want to deploy this to a
  server before the demo, so they can look at it afterward?)
- adding a person
- adding an event
- adding a person to an event
*** Things to come:
- q: notes fields? narrative?
- question: same name, how do you tell people apart? phone?
- question: venues v institutions -- same list? see "sites"
- searching for people, including on event attendance (multiple events?)
- adding a new (not in db) person from an event page 
- add new model instance from the change list page, maybe? (add seems
  very far away)
- narrow the frame so that add/change are next to the list of model
  types
