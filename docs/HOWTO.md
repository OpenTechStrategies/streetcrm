# How To Use SWOPtact #

### Log in
  - An admin user will need to create a username and password for you.  Use these to log in.
-  "Site Administration" page
   - Clicking on either the SWOP logo or "Contacts" title will return you to this list of the kinds of elements that the logged-in user has permission to edit.
   - The purple banner will show you where you are in the site at all times.  Right now it shows "Home," and you can always click on the home (or the logo) to get out of an inner page.
   - Search (see "Miscellaneous" for details).  If you know that you're looking for a specific person, institution, or action, type the name in the search bar.
   - To log out or change the password (if the logged-in user has permission to change their password), click the three horizontal lines at the top right, next to the "welcome, (user)" text.  You need to click directly on the text in that dropdown menu, not elsewhere in the highlighted row.
   - The list of elements under "site administration" shows what kinds of things the logged-in user has permission to edit.  We'll go through those below.
   - See more about the missing data report in "Miscellaneous," below.
   
### Click on "Actions"   
-  You'll see a list of actions.
   - This list can be filtered by tag and by whether or not the action has been archived.  These filters are available on the right side of the center panel.
   - You can also sort the list by the column headers.  When you sort by a header, an arrow will appear to show which direction the list is being sorted, and an X will appear that allows you to undo the sorting if you want.  You can sort by multiple columns, so if you want to sort by one and then by another (instead of combining them), make sure you click the "X" to get rid of the first sort.
- Click on "Create new action"
  - Most of the fields are straightforward.  Some are filled by autocompletion: organizer, second organizer, tags, connected action.  To fill those in, start typing and then select something from the autocompletion list that appears.  If the organizer (or secondary organizer) you need doesn't appear in the list, just type his or her name.  Similarly, if you don't see the connected action that you need, just type its name and it will be created when you save the page.  However, new tags _cannot_ be created on this page.  You can only use a tag if it appears via autocompletion.
  - Click on the calendar icon to add date of action.
  - Note the message at the bottom that reminds you that you need to save before adding attendees.
  - Click "Save Changes."
    - Clicking this will save the page and stay here.
  - To leave the page and return to the list of actions, click on "Actions" in the breadcrumb in the purple bar at the top of the page.  Or, click on the logo and then click on "Actions" again from the front page.
- Edit an action.  Click on the action you just created.
  - The organizers and connected action now show up as static text with an "x" next to them.  Clicking the "x" will remove them and return an empty text box.  Click the "x" to change those fields.
  - Scroll down to the "Attendees" section.
    - Click "Add New" to add the first attendee.  Use autocompletion to find the names from the sign-in sheet.  If the name doesn't show up in the autocompletion list, then just keep typing it.  Tab to the next column to enter the institution.
    - Similarly, the institution should be entered from the autocompletion selections, but if it doesn't appear, type the name of the institution.  The word "[NEW]" will appear next to the institution name if it doesn't appear already in the database.  Tabbing away or entering will save that new institution and link it to the participant.
    - Tab or click over to add the phone number.  The phone number can be accepted in a few different formats, but it must be a valid phone number and must have the area code.  If you enter the full number and are still getting an error, check the format and then check the number.  If the area code is not valid then the phone number will error and not save.
    - The final column is a red "x" that removes the attendee from the sign-in sheet.
  - You'll see that each row has "i"s that link to the participant page and institution page.  Click either of those (they'll each open in a new tab) to see and edit more information about the person and the institution (respectively).
  - Clicking, tabbing, or clicking enter from each cell in this table will auto save it.
  - If you see a typo in an attendee name that has already been entered, editing it from the attendee list will edit it everywhere in the database.  Therefore, if you realize that someone is on the attendee list who should not be, click the red "x" to remove the row instead of editing the name.  Editing the name will not add a different person -- it will change the name of that person, which might mean that the new name is associated with the wrong institution, phone number, title, and other information.
  
### Click on "Institutions"
- List of institutions
   - Like actions, you can filter the institutions by archived status.  Active institutions are those that have not been archived.  All shows both archived and active institutions.
   - You can also filter by tags.  Clicking on a tag will cause the list to show only those institutions that have been tagged with that tag.  If you click on a tag and no institutions appear, then no institutions have that tag.  Click "All" under "By Tag" to get back to the list of all institutions, regardless of their tag(s).
- Click on "Create new institution"
  - The only required field here is the institution's name, but as usual you should fill in as much information as you have.
   - Tags will autocomplete.  New tags can't be created here.  If you are an administrator, you'll be able to create them on a separate page.
   - The checkbox next to "Is this institution a member of SWOP?" just indicates yes or no.  Check it if the institution you're adding is a member of SWOP.
   - Some institutions will have contacts.  You must save the institution first in order to add contacts as a next step.  Click "Done" to save a new institution, and see below to add contacts.  Clicking "Done" will return you to the list of institutions.
-  Edit an institution.  Click on the institution you just created, or any institution name from the list of institutions.
   - Just as with actions, you can add multiple tags to an institution.  The text box will remain to the right of the tags you've added, so that you can continue to type into it to add tags.  Once again, tags cannot be created here.  Type into the text box and choose a tag from the autocompletion menu that appears.  If you don't see the tag you need and you are an administrator, go to the Create Tag page to create the tag.
   - If you add an incorrect tag, click the "x" to remove it.
   - Scroll down to the "Contacts" section.
      - This section works exactly like the "Attendees" section on an Action, except that only administrative users can add and edit institutional contacts.
      - Add a new contact to the institution by clicking the "add new" button.
      - Each institution can have up to to 4 contacts, but no more.  If you try to add more than 4 contacts, you'll see an error flash as a reminder that you've reached the limit.
      - Each contact has an "i" next to his or her name.  Click the "i" to see more information about the person open in a new tab.
      - If you are an administrative user, you can edit the contact's name, title, and phone number right in this table, just as we edited "Attendees" above.
      - The phone number errors are exactly the same as those for attendees.  If the phone number does not have the area code or has an invalid area code then it will error and not save.
      
### Click on "Participants"
- List of participants.
   - Just as with actions, participants can be sorted by the column headers of this table.  To reverse the sort order, click the arrow in the header.  To remove sorting, click the "X" in the header of the column.
   - The "By Archived Status" filter allows you to look at only active participants (the default), only archived participants, or all participants.
- Add a participant.  Click "Create new participant."
   - The participant name and institution are required.  The institution can be chosen from the autocompletion options or created (if it doesn't already exist).
   - You'll see that there are two buttons here: "Save Changes" and "Done."  Clicking "Save Changes" will stay on the same page, and "Done" will return you to the list of participants.
   - The phone number formatting follows the same rules as it does in the  "Attendees" and "Contacts" sections: be sure to include the area code, and if you get an error, double check to make sure that the phone number is valid.
   - Click "Done" to return to the list of participants.
- Edit participant.  Click on the name of the participant you just created, or any other participant on the list.
   - This page looks the same as the "create participant" page, but with an "Action History" section at the bottom.
   - The action history will be empty until the participant has been listed as attending an action (in the "Attendees" section of that action's page).
   - The action list is limited to the 5 most recent actions that the person has attended by default, but offers the option to view more.
   - Click "Done" to return to the list of participants.
   
### Click on "Tags"
- This will only be available if you are an administrator.  If you don't see "Tags" on your homepage, then skip down to the "Miscellaneous" section below.
- List of tags.
  - Just as with the other lists, you can sort by column headers here.
  - Similarly, you can also filter tags by whether or not they've been archived.
- Add a tag.  Click on "Create new tag."
  - The tag name should be short and to the point.  It is limited to 25 chars.  Make sure that no similar tag exists before creating a new tag.  The goal is to keep the total number of tags fairly low.
  - The description field can give more details about what the tag means.
  - Click "Done" to save the tag and return to the list of tags.  As with the other pages, if you don't click "Done" then your changes will not be saved.
- Edit tag.  Click on the tag you just created or any tag name in the list.
  - Most likely you won't need to edit tags, except possibly to fix typos.  This page looks exactly like it does when creating the tag, and all the same notes apply.
  - Return to the home page.
  
# User Administration #

### Click on "Users"
- Again, this will only be available if you are an administrative user.  If not, skip down to "Miscellaneous," below.
- List of users.
  - Just as with any list above, you can sort by column headers here.
  - Filtering by active/inactive is similar to filtering by archived/active in other models.
  - Filtering by group membership is like filtering by tags, and users can and will be in multiple groups.  If you click on a group and no users show up, then no users are members of that group.
- Add a user.  Click "Create new user."
  - Make sure to create a unique username.  Even if someone has the same first initial and last name as another user, be sure to give them a different username.
  - Passwords can be changed after the first creation of a user, either by the user (if they are an administrator) or by an admin on their behalf.
  - Click "done" after the initial user creation and then choose what group(s) the user should be in.  In general, do not grant superuser status and don't edit the dates.  Make sure that the user is set to active and is assigned to a group, or else he or she will not be able to log in or make any data changes.
  - The first and last name and email address are not entirely necessary, but could be good for record-keeping purposes.
  - If a user logs in and sees the message "You don't have permission to edit anything," then he or she has not been added to a group and needs an administrator to make that change to his or her user profile.
